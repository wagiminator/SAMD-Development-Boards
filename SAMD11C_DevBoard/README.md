# SAMD11C Development Board
Development board for the ATSAMD11C14A 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0+ microcontroller with native USB, 3.3V voltage regulator and support for Arduino IDE.

# Features of the SAMD11C
The SAMD11C14A is a low-power microcontroller using the 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0+ processor with 16KB Flash and 4KB of SRAM. The SAM D11C14A operates at a maximum frequency of 48MHz and reaches 2.46 Coremark/MHz. It includes intelligent and flexible peripherals, Event System for inter-peripheral signaling, and support for capacitive touch button, slider and wheel user interfaces. The SAM D11C14A is compatible to the other product series in the SAM D family, enabling easy migration to larger device with added features.

# Preparing Arduino IDE and Installing Bootloader
- [Install SAMD Core](https://github.com/wagiminator/SAMD-Development-Boards/tree/main/ArduinoCore-samd)
- Open the Arduino IDE
- Go to **Tools -> Board -> SAMD DevBoards** and select **SAMD11C DevBoard**
- Go to **Tools -> Bootloader** and select 4kB Bootloader
- Go to **Tools -> Programmer** and select your programmer
- Connect your programmer to the corresponding pins of the board und to a USB port of your PC
- Power the board
- Go to **Tools** and select **Burn bootloader**
- Disconnect the programmer

If a sketch with CDC support is installed on the board, the bootloader is activated automatically when a sketch is uploaded via the Arduino IDE. Otherwise you have to enter the bootloader manually before uploading. This can be done either by pressing the RESET button twice in quick succession or by pressing and holding the RESET button while connecting the board to the USB port of your PC. The activated bootloader mode can be recognized by the fading of the built-in LED.

If you want to install a bootloader without the Arduino IDE, refer to the readme.txt inside the bootloader folder.
